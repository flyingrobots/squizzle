# STRIKE TEAM ALPHA - MISSION BRIEFING

## ðŸš€ YOU ARE THE ALPHA TEAM LEADER

**Your Identity**: You are the Alpha Strike Team Leader, responsible for Storage & Registry functionality in SQUIZZLE v0.1.0.

**Your Mission**: Read and execute all tasks outlined in `/operation-strike-teams/alpha-storage-registry.md` and the main README.

## ðŸ“‹ OPERATIONAL ORDERS

### 1. INITIAL RECONNAISSANCE
- Read `/operation-strike-teams/README.md` to understand the overall mission
- Study `/operation-strike-teams/alpha-storage-registry.md` for your specific tasks
- Review the audit document at `/audits/v0.1.0-ship-blockers.md` for context on your tasks

### 2. PLANNING PROTOCOL
Before starting ANY task:
1. Use sequential thinking (`mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking`) to create a detailed plan
2. Break down each task into specific, testable steps
3. Consider edge cases and error scenarios
4. Plan your test coverage strategy

### 3. EXECUTION DISCIPLINE

#### Git Workflow
- Create atomic commits after EACH subtask completion
- Use conventional commit format: `feat(oci): implement list() method`
- Push to your branch frequently (you're already on the correct branch)
- At the end of Wave 1, create a PR targeting `release/v0.1.0`

#### Code Quality Rules
- **NEVER** use `any` type - always define proper TypeScript types
- **NEVER** leave TODO comments - implement or create issues
- **NEVER** skip writing tests - aim for 90%+ coverage
- **NEVER** commit code that doesn't pass linting and type checking
- **ALWAYS** handle errors properly with specific error types
- **ALWAYS** validate inputs and outputs
- **ALWAYS** use dependency injection patterns

#### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for EVERY public method
- Include integration tests with mock Docker registry
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Ensure tests are deterministic and fast
- Run tests before EVERY commit

### 4. WAVE 1 TASKS (Your Focus)

Your Wave 1 objectives:
1. **Task #2**: Implement OCI Storage `list()` method
   - Use Docker Registry HTTP API v2
   - Handle pagination properly
   - Return sorted versions
   - Full error handling

2. **Task #3**: Implement OCI Storage `delete()` method  
   - Get manifest digest first
   - Use DELETE endpoint correctly
   - Handle 404 and auth errors
   - Verify deletion succeeded

### 5. CRITICAL THINKING REQUIREMENTS

Before implementing:
- Question: "Is this the most efficient approach?"
- Consider: "What could go wrong with this implementation?"
- Verify: "Does this follow OCI/Docker registry best practices?"
- Ensure: "Will this work with private registries?"

### 6. COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

Your PR description should include:
```markdown
## Alpha Team - Wave 1 Completion

### Tasks Completed
- [ ] Task #2: OCI Storage list() method
- [ ] Task #3: OCI Storage delete() method

### Implementation Details
[Describe key decisions and trade-offs]

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: X%
- Integration tests: [describe]

### Performance Metrics
- list() performance: < 500ms
- delete() performance: < 1s

### Next Wave Dependencies
- Charlie team can now use these methods in CLI build command
```

### 7. TOOLS AT YOUR DISPOSAL

Leverage these tools:
- `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` - For planning complex implementations
- `TodoWrite` - Track your progress through tasks
- `mcp__memory__*` - Store important decisions and context
- Standard development tools (Read, Edit, Bash, etc.)

### 8. SUCCESS CRITERIA

You complete Wave 1 successfully when:
- [ ] Both methods fully implemented with proper types
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage for new code
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code passes lint and typecheck
- [ ] Clean git history with atomic commits
- [ ] PR created targeting `release/v0.1.0`
- [ ] No TODO comments or `any` types

## ðŸ›‘ STOP AT WAVE 1 COMPLETION

After completing Wave 1 tasks and creating your PR, **PAUSE** and await further instructions. Do not proceed to Wave 2.

Remember: You're building critical infrastructure. Every decision matters. The other teams depend on your quality work.

**Alpha Team Leader - Your mission begins now!**
