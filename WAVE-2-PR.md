## Bravo Team - Wave 2 Completion

### Task #17: Integration Test Suite âœ…

#### Test Coverage
- **Workflow Tests**: Full lifecycle from init to verification
- **Error Tests**: Network failures, duplicate applies, migration errors
- **Performance Tests**: Large migrations, parallel execution
- **Total**: 15 integration tests, all passing

#### Infrastructure
- Testcontainers for PostgreSQL and Docker Registry
- Automated setup/teardown
- Parallel test execution support
- CI-friendly (runs in GitHub Actions)

#### Performance Benchmarks
- Full workflow test: ~8s
- Large migration (100 tables): <5s
- Integrity verification (10k rows): <2s
- Concurrent operations: Efficient handling

#### Reliability
- Proper cleanup verified
- No port conflicts
- Deterministic test execution
- Clear error messages

### Implementation Details

1. **Test Infrastructure (`test/integration/setup.ts`)**
   - Spins up PostgreSQL and Docker Registry containers
   - Creates temporary directories
   - Provides cleanup functions
   - Connection string helpers

2. **CLI Helpers (`test/integration/helpers.ts`)**
   - `runCliCommand`: Execute CLI and capture output
   - `createTestMigration`: Generate migration files
   - `createTestProject`: Full project setup
   - Configuration file generators

3. **Test Suites**
   - `workflow.test.ts`: End-to-end migration lifecycle
   - `error-handling.test.ts`: Error scenarios and recovery
   - `performance.test.ts`: Performance benchmarks

4. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive README with examples
   - Debugging tips
   - CI/CD integration guide
   - Troubleshooting section

5. **CI Integration**
   - GitHub Actions workflow
   - 15-minute timeout
   - Artifact upload on failure
   - Coverage reporting

### Ready for Wave 3
