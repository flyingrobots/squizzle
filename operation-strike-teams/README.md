# Operation Strike Teams - SQUIZZLE v0.1.0

## Mission Brief

Complete SQUIZZLE v0.1.0 by dividing 28 tasks across 5 specialized strike teams organized into 4 waves. All teams remain busy throughout all waves with minimal idle time.

## Timeline: 4 Weeks (Wave-Based)

### 🌊 Wave 1 - Foundation (Week 1)
All teams work on foundational tasks with zero dependencies:
- **Alpha**: OCI storage list() and delete() methods
- **Bravo**: Create test coverage infrastructure
- **Charlie**: Binary setup and CLI help examples
- **Delta**: System table init and integrity verification
- **Echo**: Error recovery docs and shell completion

### 🌊 Wave 2 - Building (Week 2)
Teams build on their own Wave 1 work:
- **Alpha**: CLI build push to storage
- **Bravo**: Integration test framework
- **Charlie**: Build command enhancements (size, dry-run)
- **Delta**: Environment validation and version checks
- **Echo**: Logging and telemetry infrastructure

### 🌊 Wave 3 - Integration (Week 3)
Cross-team dependencies emerge:
- **Alpha**: Get last version from storage
- **Bravo**: Test automation scripts
- **Charlie**: Artifact signing (depends on Delta)
- **Delta**: Security SBOM and rollback implementation
- **Echo**: TypeScript configs and progress indicators

### 🌊 Wave 4 - Polish (Week 4)
Final features and optimization:
- **Alpha**: Docker registry authentication
- **Bravo**: Migration validation framework
- **Charlie**: Caching for remote operations
- **Delta**: Efficient tarball streaming
- **Echo**: Complete documentation suite
